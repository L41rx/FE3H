     __________________________________________________________________

   Fire Emblem Three Houses Combat Arts List FE3H Guide In Fire Emblem
   Three Houses : Nintendo Switch

   Combat Arts is a unique attack that first appeared in Fire Emblem
   Echoes : Shadows of Valentia. Each time a unit attacks, it can be
   triggered after certain conditions are met. Combat Arts have various
   effects. They have the effect of dealing additional damage. However,
   not all of them have additional effects. In addition to dealing
   additional damage, some of them can increase the unit’s combat stats.
   However, not all of them have additional effects, and they cannot
   trigger follow-up attacks.

   Unlike in Echoes, some details are changed in this series. Combat Arts
   no longer consumes units HP in Fire Emblem Three Houses. Instead, these
   special attacks have been changed to consume weapon durability. If the
   weapon’s durability reaches zero, the effectiveness of this special
   attack will be diminished. Also in FE3H, Combat Arts aren’t belonged to
   specific weapons. Instead, characters may learn them when they increase
   their weapon skill levels.

   How to use it : If unit has an Art unlocked, press ‘A’ to bring up
   their menu, choose the ‘Combat Arts option’, choose the move you want
   to use, then select target.
