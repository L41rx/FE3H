In Imperial Year 1171, Edelgard was taken to Faerghus by her uncle, Lord Arundel, and she quickly befriended her maternal stepbrother Dimitri. When she returned to the Empire in 1174, he gave her a dagger as a parting gift. At some point in her childhood, she and all ten of her siblings were imprisoned by a conspiracy of nobles including Arundel, Duke Aegir, and Lord von Vestra, with Ionius IX helpless to stop them. The siblings were subjected to horrific experimentation in order to implant them with the Crest of Flames, and ultimately Edelgard was the sole survivor and successful test subject. Developing a hatred of the Crest system that had dominated FÃ³dlan for a millennium, Edelgard swore to destroy the Crests and the Church of Seiros which upheld their power by any means necessary and unite FÃ³dlan under the Adrestian banner to create world peace.',

When she returned to the Empire in 1174, he gave her a dagger as a parting gift. In 1176, he was the sole survivor of the Tragedy of Duscur, in which his father King Lambert and many of his knights and friends were murdered, allegedly by assassins from the Duscur region. This incident permanently warped the young prince, leaving him with a deep-seated grudge against the perpetrators and a hidden capacity for extreme violence, although he always suspected that the people of Duscur had been scapegoated. In the aftermath of the Tragedy, he saved a young Duscur commoner named Dedue from being lynched, leading him to develop an extremely strong sense of loyalty towards Dimitri.',
